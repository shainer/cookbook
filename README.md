# Cookbook (work in progress)

After trying to build a complete GUI application to manage my recipes, I
decided writing GUIs is too boring, especially in C++, and I was never going
to complete it.

But, I still need something nice to manage my recipes. So I am trying again
with a simpler and more specialized CLI tool backed by a SQLite database.
In case I decide GUIs are less boring in Rust, this might eventually get a
GUI, but I am not planning for that right now.
